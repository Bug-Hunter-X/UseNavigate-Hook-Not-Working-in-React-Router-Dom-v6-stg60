In React Router Dom v6, a common error is related to the `useNavigate` hook not working correctly within a functional component.  This often manifests as the `navigate` function appearing to do nothing, or throwing an error. This is frequently caused by improper usage or context within a component. For example, directly using `navigate` within a synchronous function might not trigger the navigation as expected, because `useNavigate` needs to be within a function that is called after rendering. Using it with useEffect hook often resolves this, as shown in the solution.
